## Description
This dapp is a simple event booking dapp for night clubs. The night club owner can create passes for each event and create different tickets depending on the status of the table. If a ticket is tagged VVIP(very very important persons) that means it would cost 3cUSD to attend, then if VIP(very important person) it would cost 2cUSD. This would enable the owner to automatically rank events based on their grade. In this website, only the admin has the ability to create night club events.
